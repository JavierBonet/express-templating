To do:

  [√]  Create an sh script that takes a resource name and creates:
    - routes: get all, get by id, post, put, delete
    - services: getAll, getById, create, update, delete
    - repositories: getAll, getById, create, update, remove
    - entity
    - data-source.ts file
    - Example: scriptName generate-resource resourceName

  [√] Check if using library 'commander' can help with the help command (maybe also replacing the yargs library)
